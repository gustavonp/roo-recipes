### Ingredients

- 2 cups unsalted skinless peanuts
- 2 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt

> You can add 1 tsp of lemon juice as a natural preservative, but it's not necessary.

### Directions

1. Put all ingredients into a food processor until it reaches the desired consistency. It takes some time until the peanuts release their natural oil, so be patient.
