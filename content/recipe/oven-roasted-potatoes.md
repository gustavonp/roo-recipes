### Ingredients

- 4kg yellow potatoes pounds (about 2kg) russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters, sixths, or eighths, depending on size (see note above)
- 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 small bunch rosemary leaves
- 3 medium garlic cloves
- 1 small bunch Parsley leaves
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- Salt and pepper

### _Mise en place_

1. Mince the parsley and garlic cloves.

2. Finely chop the rosemary.

3. Peel and cut the potatoes into quartes or sixths depending on their size.

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450 °F / 230 °C (or 400°F/200°C if using convection).

2. Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling.

3. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, baking soda, and potatoes and stir.

4. Reduce to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes. The potatoes should be soft enough when pierced with a knife.

5. Meanwhile, combine olive oil, rosemary, garlic, and black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat.

6. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden.

7. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl.

8. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.

9. When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate.

10. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.

11. Transfer potatoes to a large baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly.

12. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. 

13. Shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.

14. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley. 

15. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste.
