### Ingredients

- 4 cloves garlic

- ½ large yellow onion

- 1 tablespoon brown sugar

- 2 teaspoons salt

- 1 teaspoons pepper

- 1 pinch cayene pepper

- 2 pounds (1 kg) boneless, skinless chicken thighs

- ¾ cup ketchup

- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

- ½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

- 1 tablespoon thinly slices green onions

- ½ cup diced jalapeño pepper

- Hot sauce to taste

- 1 cup water

- Hamburger buns

### _Mise en place_

1. Mince the garlic cloves

2. Dice the onion

3. [Pat the chicken thighs dry with a paper towel.](## "This helps the seasoning").

### Directions

1. Oil the saucepan, add garlic, yellow onion, brown sugar, kosher salt & pepper, cayenne, chicken thighs, ketchup, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and a dash of hot sauce.

<blockquote class="warning">Add these ingredients in that exact order.</blockquote>

2. Heat those ingredients over high heat until you hear the garlic sizzling. Let garlic sizzle for about 30 seconds before adding the water.

3. Stir everything together and wait until the mixture starts boiling.

4. Reduce heat to medium-low and let it simmer, stirring occasionally until the chicken falls apart, about 1 1/2 hours.

5. Add the green onions and peppers and cook until the peppers turn tender, about 3 to 5 minutes more. 

6. Taste for seasoning.

7. Remove from heat and serve on hamburger buns.

<blockquote class="with-roo">I highly recommend toasting the buns first before serving. It helps with the structure of the sandwich.</blockquote>
