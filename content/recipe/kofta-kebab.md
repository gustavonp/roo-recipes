### Ingredients

- 1kg ground beef
- 3 tablespoon onion
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoon parsley
- 1 tablespoon oil
- Kebab skewers

### _Mise en place_

1. Thinly mince the onions and parsley.

2. If you plan on grilling these kebabs, I recommend soaking the skewers in water.

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 °F / 180 °C.
2. In a bowl, mix the ground beef, parsley, onion, salt and pepper, breaking up the ground beef with your hands.
3. Divide the kofta evenly into ten portions.
4. Wrap each portion on the tip of the skewers in the shape of a sausage.
5. Lightly oil the koftas and a baking tray before setting it into the oven for 30 minutes.

> Be sure to break up the ground beef thoroughly with your fingers. If the kofta is too moist, add 1 tablespoon of breadcrumb.
