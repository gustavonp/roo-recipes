### Ingredients

- 10 lasagna noodles
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 450g mild or spicy italian sausage
- ½ large onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes (optional)
- 800ml crushed tomatoes
- ½ cup hot water
- parmesan cheese, grated
- 200g mozzarella cheese
- Ricotta cheese, to taste
- Fresh basil

> You can switch the Italian sausage to ground beef if you want to spend less on this dish.

### _Mise en place_

1. Break the lasagna noodles into bite-size pieces.

2. Remove the skin of the Italian sausages.

3. Thinly chop the onion.

4. Crush and peel the garlic cloves.

5. Cut your mozzarella into small cubes.

5. Finely chop the basil.

### Directions

1. In a skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat.

2. Add the Italian sausages. Mash up until every piece is brown on the outside and slightly pink on the inside.

3. Remove the sausage from the pan and drain it on a paper towel-lined plate.

4. Using the leftover sausage fat, sauté the onions until softened and the edges begin to turn translucent.

5. Add the garlic cloves and red pepper flakes. Toasting together for 30 seconds or until fragrant.

6. Pour the [crushed tomatoes](## "You can add a can of tomato paste if you want a thicker sauce") into the pot with a cup of hot water.

7. Bring to a simmer and add the broken lasagna noodles. Fold the noodle pieces into the tomato sauce until every piece gets coated.

8. Once it's back up to a simmer with the lid on, reduce the heat to medium-low.

9. Slowly cook the pasta for 20 minutes or until the noodles are fully cooked. Stir every five minutes to ensure the noodles won't stick to the pan or each other.

10. Once the noodles are cooked, add the parmesan cheese and mozzarella. Stir so that the cheese is evenly distributed.

11. Once everything is mixed add a few spoons of ricotta cheese on top, letting it melt on top and remove it from the heat with the lid on.

12. Once it’s finished, garnish with finely chopped basil.
