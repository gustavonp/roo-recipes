### Ingredients

- 1 cups butter

> If you want to use it as a spreadable I recommend salted. If you're using it for a recipe, use unsalted.

### _Mise en place_

1. Cut the butter into squares to make it easier to melt.

### Directions

1. Melt the butter on a wide pan over medium heat.

2. Whisk the butter every 1 or 2 minutes.

3. After 5 minutes, the butter will start getting dark.

4. Once the butter gets a nice brown colour, bring it to a small bowl, and let it cool.

> Make sure to get all the small burned granules. Those are packed with flavour.

5. Let the butter rest in the fridge until it solidifies. If you wish to use it on recipes just let it cool down to room temperature.
