### Ingredients

- 2 cups long-grain rice
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- ½ cup sliced almonds
- ½ cup red pepper
- ½ cup champignon
- ½ cup scallion
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ½ lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon basil

### _Mise en place_

1. Dice the red peppers and the champignons

2. If you can't find sliced almonds, thinly slice them.

### Directions

1. Heat a large pot over medium heat with vegetable broth. Once it starts to boil, add the rice, partially covering it with the lid.

2. Heat a non-stick frying pan, and cook the almonds with butter over medium heat. Cook until the almonds get a nice golden brown colour.

3. When the vegetable broth simmers to the same level as the rice, add ½ cup of water and let it simmer for a little longer.

4. Once the rice is cooked, add the champignons and stir everything together to incorporate.

6. Add the ref peppers, lemon juice, basil and salt. Cover the rice and let it cook for 5 more minutes.

7. Add the almonds and scallions before serving.
