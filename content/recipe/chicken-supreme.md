### Ingredients

- 1 small bunch thyme
- 1 bunch parsley
- 4 chicken breasts
- 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 stick butter

### _Mise en place_

1. Let the chicken breast reach room temperature out of the refrigerator.

2. Pet the chicken breast dry, then season with salt and pepper.

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425 °F / 220 °C.

2. Meanwhile, place a large [skillet](## "Preferably an iron cast or any skillet that can go into the oven) over high heat and add olive oil.

3. Once the olive oil is well heated, lower the heat to medium and add garlic and thyme.

4. Place the chicken breasts, skin-side down, into the pan. Don’t move the chicken until the skin releases and browns on the edges, about 4 minutes.

5. Tilt the chicken to the edge of the pan, searing the sides, about 10 seconds per side.

6. Flip the chicken and add 6 tablespoons of butter. As the butter melts, carefully and continuously spoon it over the chicken, basting the skin until golden, about 3 minutes.

7. Flip the chicken back to the skin-side down and transfer the pan to the oven for about 10 minutes, until golden brown and juices run clear.

8. Remove from oven and transfer the chicken to a plate to rest.

<blockquote class="with-roo">The secret is quickly searing the chicken breast before transferring it to the oven. So it gets a nice brown colour on the outside and is still moist on the inside. I also highly recommend using the fat and juice left on the skillet to sauté some onions or vegetables, don't simply wash it off. All the flavour of the meat is there!</blockquote>
