### Ingredients

- 4 eggs
- 2 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon chives
- 1 tablespoon sour cream or cream cheese.

### _Mise en place_

1. Thinly chop the chives

> When cutting herbs for seasoning, make sure your knife is well-sharpened. If your chopping board is soaked with green juice coming from your herbs, you're losing all its flavour.

### Directions

1. Into a nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.

2. Add the eggs to the skillet

<div class="warning with-roo">Never season raw eggs! Salt breaks the egg proteins, making them runny and losing too much water.</div>

3. Constantly stir and turn the eggs until the eggs start to cook, scraping down the bottom and sides.

> Use a silicone spatula when cooking eggs.

4. Remove from heat and continue stirring every time it starts to stick to the bottom of the pan.

5. Return to heat, stirring continuously for about 4 minutes.

6. Fold in chives, sour cream, salt and pepper, folding in to incorporate.
