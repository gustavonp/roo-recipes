### Ingredients

- 250gr chickpeas
- 2 minced garlic cloves
- 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Â½ tbsp cumin
- 1 tbsp tahini

### _Mise en place_

1. If you buy dry chickpeas, you must leave them overnight in a bowl of water before preparing them. So, I highly recommend using canned chickpeas on your first try.

### Directions

1. Drain and rinse the chickpeas into a large pot, cover with 3 centimetres of water and bring it to a boil.

2. Reduce the heat and simmer until they reach your desired tenderness (around 1 to 1/2 hours).

2. Drain the chickpeas one more time after cooked and bring them to a food processor with lemon juice, olive oil, cumin, minced garlic, tahini, salt and 1 tbsp of water.

3. After a few minutes of processing, the chickpeas become a thick, whipped paste. Add more water if you wish to make it smoother.

> The time may vary if you're using canned chickpeas instead.
