### Ingredients

- 2 cups whole milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup honey
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 3 egg yolks
- Salt

### Directions

1. Pour the milk into a medium pot over medium heat, add the vanilla extract and bring the milk just under a boil.

2. Add the honey and stir for a few minutes, allowing the vanilla to steep into the milk.

3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, cornstarch, egg yolks and a pinch of salt.

4. While whisking, pour a little of the hot milk into the bowl to [temper the mixture](## "This prevents the eggs from cooking under the heat").

5. Pour everything back into the pot. Turn up the head a little and cook for about 5 minutes or more, stirring constantly.

6. Once the mixture has thickened, remove it from the heat and strain it through a mesh sieve into a clean bowl.

7. Cover with plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to help the pudding set.
