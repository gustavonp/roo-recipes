### Ingredients

- 2 Baking potatoes
- Olive oil
- 2 tablespoons of butter
- Parsley and thyme
- Salt and pepper

### _Mise en place_

1. Wash the potatoes thoroughly.

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 °F / 220 °C.

2. Cut a small section of the potatoes, so they can lay flat on your cutting board without wobbling around.

3. Set the potatoes between two chopsticks or wooden spoons, carefully chop the potatoes into thin slides, making sure you don't cut them all the way through. Use the wooden spoons to prevent you from completely slicing the potatoes.

4. Set a baking tray with tin foil. Set your potatoes into the tray and brush the olive oil all over the potatoes surface.

5. Sprinkle salt on top, rubbing the salt all over the potatoes skin.

6. Bring your potatoes into the oven for the initial baking, about 20 minutes.

7. In the meantime, heat your butter in a saucepan over low heat, add your herbs and cook for just a minute.

8. After 20 minutes, pull the potatoes out and brush your seasoned butter on top of the potatoes, bringing them back into the oven for extra 15 minutes.

> Repeat this process ever 15 minutes 2 or 3 more times.

9. Lastly, with the help of a knife, gently open up some of the potato slits to ensure the center is nice and cooked.

> You can add cheese or other toppings before serving. Just add extra 5 minutes to this last step.
