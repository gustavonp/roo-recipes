### Ingredients

- 1 litre 2% milk
- 4 tablespoon apple vinegar
- 4 tablespoon water
- 2 tablespoon butter
- Salt
- Parsley, thinly sliced

### Directions

1. Bring the milk to a boil and set aside 30 ml (1/4 cup) of it.

2. Remove it from the heat and add the vinegar and water. Let it curdle.

3. Once the milk has curdled, pass it on a strainer to remove the excessive water.

4. Bring it to a blender with the butter, salt, parsley, and the 30ml of milk you set aside previously, blending the mixture to the desired consistency.

5. Let it rest overnight.

> Aside from parsley, you can season it with anything you want. Try garlic, pepper or even olives.
