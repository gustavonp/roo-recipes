### Ingredients

**For the crust**

- 1 ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 stick unsalted butter, frozen
- Ice water

**For the topping**

- 1 quart Blueberries
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- ¼ cup port wine
- 8 ounces mascarpone
- ¼ cup powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream

### _Mise en place_

**For the crust**

1. Cut the unsalted butter into small cubes

**For the topping**

1. Trim the tops off the strawberries and slice them thinly.

### Directions

**For the crust**

1. Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Making sure both ingredients are well mixed.

2. Add the small butter cubes to the mixture. Make sure all of the butter is coated in flour.

3. Slowly add 1 tablespoon of ice water to the mixture at a time, using your hands or a spatula to combine all ingredients. Continue adding the ice water slowly and mixing the dough until it starts to hold its shape.

4. Turn the dough onto a flat, floured work surface and gently knead it until your dough looks nice and homogenous.

> The dough might look dry at this point. But it'll look better once the dough rests in the fridge.

5. Roll your dough into a disc shape and wrap it in plastic wrap. Place the dough into the fridge and let it sit for at least 30 minutes.

6. Bring the dough back to the flat, floured surface. Roll the dough out to a diameter that is one to two inches wider than the pie plate you intend to use, adding more flour to the surface when necessary.

7. Carefully put your dough on your pie plate, carefully setting down the corners of your crust. Trim off any excess dough on the edge of the pie plate.

8. Let it rest in the fridge for another 30 minutes.

9. Line the pie dough with aluminum foil and fill it with the pie weight of your choice, such as rice or dry beans. Place in a 400 °F / 200 °C  oven for 12 to 15 minutes until lightly brown. Remove the foil and poke the crust by poking several little holes in the bottom of the crust using a fork.

10. Place back into the oven for another 7 to 9 minutes until a little more golden brown.

**For the topping**

1. Bring with blueberries with the granulated sugar into a saucepan over medium heat, cooking until the blueberries are very soft and most of its juice is on the saucepan.

2. Strain the mixture into a bowl, using a spoon to squeeze the blueberries to extract as much juice as you can.

5. In a medium bowl, combine the mascapone, powdered sugar, and heavy cream, beating until combined.

**Assembling**

1. Preheat the oven to 375 °F / 190 °C.

2. When the crust has cooled completely, spread the mascarpone mix evenly across the bottom. Layer the blueberry jam on top.

3. Bring the tart into the oven for about 15 minutes.
