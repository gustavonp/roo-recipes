### Ingredients

- 2 center-cut salmon filets, deboned with skin on
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- 1 slice of lemon

### Directions

1. [Score the skin](## "Cut 2 or 3 slices on the skin lengthwise") of the salmon.

> Scoring the skin helps prevent the salmon from curving while being cooked.

2. Season both sides and inside the crevasses with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

3. Into a nonstick pan, heat a drizzle of oil over medium-high heat. Gently place the salmon into the pan, skin-side down.

4. Cook for 6 or 7 minutes, with the skin side down, turning on its sides at the end.

5. Squeeze a little bit of lemon juice on the scored skin or before serving the salmon.

> Keep the skin side down all the time to give the skin a nice, crispy texture. Plus, you can see the fish slowly getting ready.
