### Ingredients

- 4 eggs
- 2 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon chives
- 1 tablespoon sour cream or cream cheese.

### _Mise en place_

1. Thinly chop the chives

> When cutting herbs for seasoning, make sure your knife is well sharpen, if your chopping board is soaked with green juice coming from your herbs you're losing all its flavour.

### Directions

1. Into a nonstick skiller, melt the butter over medium heat.

2. Add the eggs into the skillet

> Never season raw eggs! Salt breaks the egg proteins and makes them runny and lose too much water.

3. Constantly stir and turn the eggs until they start to thicken, scraping down the bottom and sides.

> Use silicone spatula when cooking eggs.

4. Remove from heat and continue to stir every time it starts to stick to the bottom of the pan.

5. Return to heat, stirring continuously for about 4 minutes.

6. Fold in chives, sour cream, S&P, folding in to incorporate.
