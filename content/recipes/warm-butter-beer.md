- 100g butter
- 1 cup demerara or brown sugar

- Â½ teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 2cm ginger
- 3 pints or 1.5l Ale beer
- 5 egg yolks

2. Grate the 2cm of ginger

### Directions

1. Pour the ale into a pot along with nutmeg, ginger, and cloves.

2. bring it to a light simmer over low heat.

> Don't heat for too long. Don't let it boil. Otherwise, all the alcohol will be gone.

3. Whisk the 5 egg yolks with the sugar.

4. Gently temper the eggs with the ale by adding [a little bit](## "Scoop some of the beer with a ladle") of the ale to the eggs so they don't cook with the heat of your drink, slowly adding 2 or 3 scoops of your drink on your eggs, mixing the mixture.

5. Once the eggs are tempered, pour everything into the pot, adding the butter and stirring until everything is combined.
