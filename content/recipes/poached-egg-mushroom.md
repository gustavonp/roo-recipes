### Ingredients

- 1 cup diced bacon
- 4 cups chopped champignon
- 2 tablespoon butter
- 4 thick slices brioche toasts
- 2 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- 4 eggs

### Directions

1.	Fill a medium-size sauce pot with water and bring to a gentle boil.

2.	Heat a large skillet and cook bacon until lightly browned.

3.	Add mushrooms to bacon and stir, coating mushrooms with rendered bacon fat. Season with S&P and cook until moisture releases (about 5 minutes).

4.	Add butter to the pan, melt and sautÃ© mushroom mixture while the butter browns, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer mixture to a paper towel-lined plate to drain off fat.

5.	Take slices of toasted brioche and press into the leftover pan grease, then arrange on plates. Top each slice with even amount of mushroom and bacon.

> Use the bacon and mushroom juices to season your bread. Just be careful not to soak it.

6.	Season boiling water with salt and add white wine vinegar. Stir the water with a whisk until swirling. Crack eggs into individual small bowls. Lower each bowl and gently drop eggs into water.

> White vinegar helps the egg white stiffen around the egg when you poach it.

7.	Turn heat down to simmer. After 2 minutes, check eggs. If they are firm to touch, remove from water; if they wobble, put back into water for another 10 seconds.

8.	Remove eggs to paper towel-lined plate to drain excess moisture.

9.	Turn eggs presentation side up, season with S&P, a drizzle of extra juices from mushroom pan and transfer to the tops of each toast. Serve immediately.
