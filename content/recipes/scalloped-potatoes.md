### Ingredients

- 3 medium baking potatoes
- 2 garlic cloves
- 3 tablespoon butter
- 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups milk
- Powdered mustard
- Salt and pepper
- 1 cup shredded white cheddar
- ½ cup parmesan cheese

### _Mise en place_

1. Wash the potatoes. We're cooking with the peel on.

2. Slice the potatoes into thin (.5cm) slices.

2. Chop the garlic.

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 °F / 180 °C.

2. Into a large pan, bring half of the pan with water to a boil

3. Par boil the potato slices for 3 to 4 minutes. Drain and set aside.

4. Into a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped garlic. Cooking for 1 to 2 minutes.

5. Start adding the flour, constantly stirring until it's smooth.

> Lower the heat so you don't get all the moisture off the butter while adding the flour.

6. Once the flour is incorporated into the butter, add the milk, continuously stirring as you pour the milk.

7. Season with salt, pepper, and mustard.

8. Once the sauce starts to get thick, add the cheddar and take it off the heat, stirring it until the cheese incorporates with your sauce.

9. Bring your sauce and potatoes into a large bowl. Toss them together until the potatoes are fully coated by the sauce.

10. Into a baking glass tray, grease it with oil before adding your scalloped potatoes, topping with parmesan cheese.

11. Cover the potatoes with [tin foil](## "shine side up") and brig it into the over for 45 minutes.

12. Remove the tin foil and bake for extra 15 minutes.
