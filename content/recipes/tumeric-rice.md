> A delightful, colourful alternative for a classic side dish.

### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 onion diced
- 3 cloves garlic crushed
- 1½ cups long-grain rice
- 1½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 small bay leaves (optional)

### Directions

1. Wash the rice under running water until the water runs clear.

2. Heat the olive oil on medium heat in a pot, when the oil is [just hot](## "Not smoking!") saute the diced onion until soft and translucent.

3. Then add the garlic and cook for a 1 minute.

3. Add the rice, salt, and turmeric mix.

4. Cover with water. You want the water to cover the rice by 1cm. 

5. Add the bay leaves if using.

6. Once the water is boiling, lower the heat down to the lowest setting possible, cover with the lid and set your timer to 10 minutes.

7. With a fork, dig a small hole and check if the water was [fully absorbed](## "Don't let it dry completely, otherwise you'll burn the rice.") by the rice.

8. Remove the pot from heat and let it rest for 10 minutes with the lid on.

9. Remove the lid, and fluff the rice with a fork.

> Washing the rice beforehand reduces the excess starch on the rice kernels. Giving it a nice fluffy texture once it's cooked.
