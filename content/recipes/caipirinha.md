### Ingredients

- 1 lime
- 2 tablespoons of sugar
- 2 ounces of cachaça (60ml)
- Ice

### _Mise en place_

1. Cut the two ends of the lime, cut the whole lime on vertically and cut the core off.

2. Once the core of the lime is removed, cut the rest in quarters.

### Directions

1. Put the slices of lime into a glass and top it with sugar

> Lime first, sugar second. The order is important.

2. Muddle the mixture of sugar and lime slides.

3. Fill up the glass with ice

4. Add the 2 ounces of cachaça

> The center of the lime gives your drink a bitter taste. So it's important to cut it over before you muddle it.
