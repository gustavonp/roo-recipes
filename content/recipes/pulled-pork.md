### Ingredients

1. 2kg pork shoulder
2. 2 onions
4. 4 garlic cloves
5. 1 cup chicken broth
6. 1 tablespoon chilli powder
7. 1 tablespoon kosher salt
7. ½ tablespoon cumin  
8. 1 brown sugar
9. ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
10. BBQ sauce (optional)

### _Mise en place_

1. Slide the onions and garlic.

2. Mix the chilli powder, salt, cumin, brown sugar, and cinnamon into a small bowl to be used as a spice rub.

### Directions

1. Pat the pork shoulder dry with a paper towel and rub it all with the spice rub mixture.

> Make sure you cover all areas of the meat.

2. Into your Slow cooker, add a layer of onions, garlic and chicken broth before adding the pork shoulder on top of the bed of onions.

3. Turn on your slow cooker and let it cook for 6 hours on high or 8 hours on slow.

> Do not take the lid off while you're cooking!

4. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and shred the meat with two forks.

> You can remove any bones or large chunks of fat now.

5. Strain the onions and garlic from the slow cooker and add them back with the shredded pork and BBQ sauce (optional).

> You can add a little bit of the liquid back to the slow cooker to make the meat a little moist.
