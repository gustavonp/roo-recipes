### Ingredients

- 4 McIntosh apples
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 2 tablespoon water
- 1 tablespoon butter (unsalted).

### _Mise en place_

1. Peel and slice the 4 apples in sixth slices.

### Directions

1. Toss the apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg into a bowl, coating the apples entirely.
2. Cook apple mixture, water, and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir occasionally for 8 to 10 minutes or until the apples are tender.

> Careful not to overcook the apples. You want them tender, not mushy. Try serving it with ice cream.
