### Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 3 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 ¼ cups milk
- 1 egg
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted
- Maple

### Directions

1. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. 

2. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg, and melted butter; mix until smooth.

2. Heat a lightly oiled frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately ¼ cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides.

3. Bathe that shortstack with maple goodness.

> You can store the pancake batter in the fridge for two to four days. Save a bottle of empty ketchup to help you pour pancake batter.
