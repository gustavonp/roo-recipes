### Ingredients

**For the rolls**

- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 cup warm whole milk
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 egg
- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- Salt

**For the frosting**

- 2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream

### Directions

**For the rolls**

1. Preheat oven to 350 °F / 180 °C.

2. In a large bowl, combine the butter, warm milk, and honey, stirring until the honey has dissolved.

3. Add a pinch of salt and yeast, followed by the egg and flour, mixing it completely until you have a smooth batter.

4. Spoon even into a cupcake or donut tray. Allow to rise for just 30 minutes, then bake for 15 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the rolls comes out clean.

**For the frosting**

1. Cream together the cream cheese, butter, and powdered sugar in a small bowl.

2. Gradually add just enough heavy cream to get a smooth, thick icing that barely runs off a spoon.

**Assembling**

1. When the rolls are finished baking, allow to cool for 5 minutes in the tray, then tip out onto a cooling rack. When thet are completely cooled, spoon the icing over the tips of the rolls, letting it run down the sides a little.
